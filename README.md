# Live Chat Front-end Application
This is a front-end application for a live chat system. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to engage in real-time conversations. The application is built using popular technologies such as React, React Router, and Socket.IO for seamless communication.

## Features
Real-time chat: Users can send and receive messages in real-time, enabling fast and interactive conversations.
User authentication: The application supports user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can create accounts, log in, and maintain their session securely.
File upload: Users can upload files during their chat sessions using Multer, allowing for easy sharing of images, documents, and more.
Avatar support: The React Avatar library is used to display avatars for users, adding a visual element to the chat interface.
Phone number input: The React Phone Number Input component is integrated to ensure valid phone number formatting during user registration or profile updates.
Form validation: The application utilizes Formik and Yup for form validation, ensuring that user inputs are validated according to defined rules.
HTTP requests: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API, allowing the front-end to interact with the server and retrieve data as needed.
Routing: React Router is employed for managing the application's routing and providing a seamless navigation experience.
DOM rendering: React DOM is used to efficiently render the React components to the browser's DOM.
Performance monitoring: The application incorporates web-vitals to monitor and measure performance metrics, providing insights into the application's speed and efficiency.
